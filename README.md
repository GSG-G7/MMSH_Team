#**Why? :**

This is For showing our Team's Profile and our Experience in Web Development to clients.

This will simply help us to contact with our clients and make deals with them.

Anyone can see our profile, and can be confident of our experience, this will encourage him to contact us, send message with his requirments,and we will contact with him as soon as possible.


#**What? :**

A single page website, seems as a Team profile. it contains three sections: About us, Meet our team and contact us.

We have a navigation bar in our website,the visitor can navigate between the three sections immediatly in the same page without waiting other page to load.

In About us section we tried to convince  visitors with our incridible experience in web development and how we can meet their requirments so we help them to go with their bussiness to the next steps. They can trust us like if we were their own team!


In Team section we show our personal photos, role, job description, and contact info.

In Contact us section we provide a form to help anyone to fill it with his email and a message to let us contact him back to discuss the requirements or to answer his inquiry.

#**How? :**

We follow the Agile methodology.
We devided the projeact into 4 parts, each member of our team has worked on a part of them, each part has been  passed on all developing (Responsive Design, Implimenting,Checking the Accessibility) and testing stages concurrently.

- Mousa has worked on nav bar, header and footer.
- Hashem has worked on contact us section.
- Mai has worked on Team section.
- Sajeda has worked on About us section, and has       prepared this Readme for you ^_^ .

At the begining, All of us have drawn a sketch for our design, Mousa and Hashem have worked individually, Mai and Sajeda have applied the pair programming concept an have worked together on their 2 sections.All the work has been managed on the github.
